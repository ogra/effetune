# Saturation Plugins

A collection of plugins that add warmth and character to your music. These effects can make digital music sound more analog-like and add pleasant richness to the sound, similar to how vintage audio equipment colors the sound.

## Plugin List

- [Dynamic Saturation](#dynamic-saturation) - Simulates the nonlinear displacement of speaker cones
- [Hard Clipping](#hard-clipping) - Adds intensity and edge to the sound
- [Harmonic Distortion](#harmonic-distortion) - Adds unique character via harmonic distortion with independent control of each harmonic
- [Multiband Saturation](#multiband-saturation) - Shape and enhance different frequency ranges independently
- [Saturation](#saturation) - Adds warmth and richness like vintage equipment
- [Sub Synth](#sub-synth) - Generates and mixes subharmonic signals for bass enhancement

## Dynamic Saturation

A physics-based effect that simulates the nonlinear displacement of speaker cones under different conditions. By modeling the mechanical behavior of a speaker and then applying saturation to that displacement, it creates a unique form of distortion that responds dynamically to your music.

### Listening Enhancement Guide
- **Subtle Enhancement:**
  - Adds gentle warmth and slight compression-like behavior
  - Creates a natural "pushed" sound without obvious distortion
  - Adds subtle depth and dimensionality to the sound
- **Moderate Effect:**
  - Creates a more dynamic, responsive distortion
  - Adds unique movement and liveliness to sustained sounds
  - Emphasizes transients with natural-feeling compression
- **Creative Effect:**
  - Produces complex distortion patterns that evolve with the input
  - Creates resonant, speaker-like behaviors
  - Enables dramatic sound design possibilities

## Harmonic Distortion

The Harmonic Distortion plugin introduces a harmonic distortion effect that goes beyond traditional saturation. Unlike standard saturation which adds harmonics in a fixed pattern, this effect allows independent control of each harmonic component. By purposefully injecting controlled harmonic components with precise individual adjustments, it creates complex interactions that enrich your sound with new textures and dynamic character.

### Listening Enhancement Guide
- **Subtle Effect:**
  - Adds a gentle layer of harmonic warmth
  - Enhances the natural tone without overwhelming the original signal
  - Ideal for adding analog-like subtle depth
- **Moderate Effect:**
  - Emphasizes distinct harmonics for a more pronounced character
  - Brings clarity and brightness to various musical elements
  - Suitable for genres needing a balanced yet enriched sound
- **Aggressive Effect:**
  - Intensifies multiple harmonics to create a rich, complex distortion
  - Provides creative sound design possibilities for experimental tracks
  - Perfect for adding edgy and unconventional textures
- **Positive vs. Negative Values:**
  - Positive values: Create compression-like effects, controlling peaks and adding warmth with greater density
  - Negative values: Generate expansion-like effects, emphasizing dynamics and creating more open, breathing sounds

### Parameters
- **2nd Harm (%):** Controls the amount of second harmonic added (-30 to 30%, default: 2%)
- **3rd Harm (%):** Adjusts the third harmonic contribution (-30 to 30%, default: 3%)
- **4th Harm (%):** Modifies the fourth harmonic intensity (-30 to 30%, default: 0.5%)
- **5th Harm (%):** Sets the fifth harmonic level (-30 to 30%, default: 0.3%)
- **Sensitivity (x):** Adjusts the overall input sensitivity (0.1–2.0, default: 0.5)
  - Lower sensitivity provides a more understated effect
  - Higher sensitivity increases the distortion intensity
  - Works as a global control affecting the intensity of all harmonics

### Visual Display
- Real-time visualization of the harmonic interaction and distortion curve
- Intuitive sliders and input fields that provide immediate feedback
- Dynamic graph displaying changes in harmonic content as parameters are adjusted

### Quick Start Guide
1. **Initialization:** Start with default settings (2nd: 2%, 3rd: 3%, 4th: 0.5%, 5th: 0.3%, Sensitivity: 0.5)
2. **Adjust Parameters:** Use real-time feedback to fine-tune each harmonic level according to your musical context
3. **Blend Your Sound:** Balance the effect using Sensitivity to achieve either a subtle warmth or a pronounced distortion
